I developed the winning UI design using Vue.js, which should then be used by all groups of 8 as the pillar for the application. In this project, I was assigned to build the registration of groups and individuals in the activities. Our platform ended up winning the contest, and is currently being used by the University of Algarve, Faro. I'm only allowed to share the code for the high fidelity prototype.",
